        <h3>An easy pizza recipe</h3>
        <p>This thick crust pizza dough recipe yields a crust that is soft and doughy on the inside and slightly crusty on the outside.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            <h5>Toppings</h5>
            <div class="topping">
            <li>Onion slice</li>
            <li>Pepper Slice</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Smoked meat slice</li>
            <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
            </div>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir together warm water, yeast, and brown sugar in a large mixing bowl; let sit for 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Stir oil and salt into yeast mixture. Mix in 2 1/2 cups flour until incorporated. Turn dough out onto a clean, floured surface. Knead dough, adding remaining flour, a little at a time, until dough is no longer sticky. Place dough into an oiled bowl. </li>
            <li>Cover with a towel and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour. </li>
            <li>Punch down dough and form it into a tight ball. Allow dough to relax for 1 minute before rolling out.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). </li>
            <li>If baking dough on a pizza stone, place toppings on dough and bake immediately. If baking dough on a pan, lightly oil the pan and let dough rise for 15 to 20 minutes before topping and baking it</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and crust is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
